# KanbanBlazor Prototype

## Kanban Landing Page
The user arrives on a landing page describing the web application.<br>
The user can click the links in the top navigation bar,the sidebar, or the CTA at the bottom to register or login.

## User Registration using Microsoft Account
When the user clicks on the `Register` link, the user is taken to the registration page.<br>
At this time, I have decided to only use Microsoft Account for registration and login.

## Microsoft Account Login
The user is taken to a Microsoft Page to choose which account they will use.

## Microsoft Account Access
The user is asked to give permission for the application to access their Microsoft Account.

## User Registration
Now that the user is authenticated by Microsoft, they must register with the same email.

## User Registration Complete
Then the user will be asked to confirm their email (currently done without email).

## User Login
Althought the user is now registered, they still need to login.<br>
The user can click on the `Login` link in the top navigation bar or the sidebar to go to the login page.<br>
Here they will select the microsoft account that they used to register.

## After Login
After the user logs in, they are taken to the main page of the application.<br>
Notice that the top navigation bar has changed to show the username (default is the email) and added a  `Logout` link.<br>
In addition, the sidebar has changed and now shows links for the user's `Account` and a `Logout` link.

## The Kanban Page
( I am currently rebuilding the entire layout for the kanban page.There were three separate pages for Workspaces, Boards, and the current Board.
They are being replaced by a single kanban page with dropdowns for the Workspace and Board selection.The images below are simple mockups.)

The user can now click on the `Kanban` link in the sidebar to go to the kanban page.<br>
The Kanban page is protected and the user must be logged in to access it.<br>
Up until this point, clicking the Kanban link would have taken the user to the login page.
